The push method can be used to add values to the end of an array. The pop method does the opposite: it removes the value at the end of the array and returns it. 

A set of daily log entries can be represented as an array.

Values of the type object are arbitrary collections of properties.
Create an object using curly brace {} notation.

Properties -- math.max, string.length (the part after the dot directly names the property, when using square brackets the expression between the brackets is evaluated to get the property name)

The elements in an array are stored in properties.

An object is a variable with many values.
var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"}
This notation is referenced as a name:value pair, and called OBJECT PROPERTIES

OBJECT METHODS are stored in properties as function defintions.

If you access the fullName method, without (), it will return the function definition.
